    <p>Hi Everyone!!  My name is Grace Ottosen.  I'm from Washington but now live in Vernal Utah. 
         I am a web design major with a dance cluster.  i love to sing, dance, hike, camp, swim, and spend time with my family.  
         I love sports. Especially Baseball and Basketball.  I am going to be 19 soon and I am single.  I am taking this course to learn
          how to make better websites, fun and its required. 
          I have been a member of the church my whole life. </p>
         <p>One of my favorite quotes by Elder M Russell Ballard is, " The Lord isn't asking us to load up a handcart, He;s 
            asking us to fortify our faith. 
            He isn't asking us to walk across a continent, He's asking us to walk across the street to visit our neighbor.  
            He isn't asking us to give all of our worldly posessions to build a temple,
            He's asking us to attend regularly the temples already built.  He isn't asking us to die a martyr's death, He's 
            asking us to live a disciple's life.
         </p>
